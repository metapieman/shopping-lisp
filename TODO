- Change the internal shopping list representation so that if you add
  a substitutable ingredient it goes into a separate list of
  substitutable things, rather than generating N new shopping
  lists. Then at the end, when printing out final list, print out
  substitutable things and footnotes to them from the shared
  ingredients in the main list.

- The README says 'see recipes.el for examples', but fails that file
  fails to provide examples of the things described!

- Instead of printing multiple list, should print a list of common
  ingredients and then multiple alternative smaller lists which differ.

- Nicer support for teaspoons, tablespoons (US and UK).

- Should be able to substitute a list of ingredients for another list,
  e.g., instead of 'Curry paste', could have a list of all the
  ingredients required to make curry paste.

- Don't complain if ingredient is not in ingredients list (i.e., we
  don't know its category). Just put it in an 'Unknown category'
  bucket.
