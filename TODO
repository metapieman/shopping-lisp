- Instead of printing multiple list, should print a list of common
  ingredients and then multiple alternative smaller lists which differ.

- Nicer support for teaspoons, tablespoons (US and UK).

- Should be able to substitute a list of ingredients for another list,
  e.g., instead of 'Curry paste', could have a list of all the
  ingredients required to make curry paste.
